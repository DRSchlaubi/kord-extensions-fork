/**
 * Abstract class representing a data adapter. In charge of caching, storing and loading data for extensions,
 * plugins, and other parts of your bot.
 *
 * This class exists because it's intended for you to be able to create your own data adapters. As your bot is
 * configured to use a single, global adapter, this allows you to switch up how your configuration is stored,
 * as long as the eventual data translation happens via `kotlinx.serialization`.
 *
 * As storage units may provide contextual information but may not necessarily point to different actual data objects,
 * data adapters also include the concept of data IDs. These IDs are identifiers that provide a mapping between storage
 * units and the actual data objects they refer to. As an example, a file-backed data adapter will likely use the path
 * to the file here - so all storage units pointing to the same file will point at the same data object.
 *
 * Data IDs allow you to point at contextual data sources when required, allowing for quite a few different
 * possibilities in configuration. For example, different guilds, users, and so on may have their own separate
 * configurations, if you so desire. It's up to your extensions to work with this system, and only provide the extra
 * storage unit context that makes sense for the specific use-case.
 *
 * @param ID A typevar representing what you use to identify specific instances of data storage, referred to as data
 * IDs. This will often be a string, but you can use anything that can reasonably be used as the key for a map.
 * File-based data adapters will likely just use the file path here.
